Idea for Application: Lyric Identification App
If you have ever had some lyrics of a song but were not able to find out where you might have heard them
you would type them up into the application which would then return a list of possible songs and their associated artists.
Application would also use a Room database to store the search results of the user on their respective application if they wish to look back at 
their search history.

API used:
Genius API: https://docs.genius.com/ : The API has four main aspects of usage, but the ones that we will be implementing will to use the Genius's library of musical metadat to
return information about the artist and song.


MusixMatch API : https://developer.musixmatch.com : Similarly to the Genius API, should an issue occur during development of the project this API works in a similar fashion and can implemented to
return the same information as the other API.
